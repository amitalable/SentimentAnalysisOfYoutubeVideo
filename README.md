# SentimentAnalysisOfYoutubeVideo
This is the sentiment analysis on the comments of Youtube video which is recently published by Global News. 
The idea is to take atleast 100 of realtime comments posted by the different users on the currently ongoing protests by Farmers in India. 
The link of the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621oD2zBSbI&t=11s. 
It is a very simple implementation on the Sentiment Analysis which is one of the techniques used in Natural Language Processing.
