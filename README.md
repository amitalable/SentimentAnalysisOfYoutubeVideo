# SentimentAnalysisOfYoutubeVideo
This is the sentiment analysis on the comments of Youtube video which is recently published by Global News. 
The idea is to take atleast 100 of realtime comments posted by the different users on the currently ongoing protests by Farmers in India. 
The link of the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621oD2zBSbI&t=11s. 
It is a very simple implementation on the Sentiment Analysis which is one of the techniques used in Natural Language Processing.

I have implemented it into three parts:
Part 1: Scrapping the youtube comments 
        - Visit https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/sentiment-analysis-of-a-youtube-video-63ced6b7b1c4 to understand each steps in detail.
Part 2: Cleansing the data 
        - Visit https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/sentiment-analysis-of-a-youtube-video-part-2-9621b8f77e12#efdb-4f969f321b53 to understand each steps involved in detail.
Part 3: Applying Subjectivity, Polarity and Analysis to analyse sentiments of comment authors
        - Visit https://amitalable.medium.com/sentiment-analysis-of-a-youtube-video-part-3-b648d19bd666 to understand each steps involved in detail.

Disclaimer: This implementation is not the final version of Sentiment Analysis. It is just a basic implementation which shows how Natural Language Processing works.
            There will be always room for improvement.
            
I hope it will help you in understanding Sentiment Analysis a little more!!! 
Thanks for reading!!
